# User Scenario: The Characters

Our target user

Employment and accommodation are among the top three barriers to migration into Ireland and also contribute to people emigrating from Ireland. The objective of our project is to provide an application that helps with job searchers in Ireland. A particular focus for our application is people looking to relocate into Ireland or within Ireland.

Search is a complex task, especially when it involves multiple different sources. Our goal is to simplify the retrieval and presentation of information to help our target user with their decision making.

In developing this project idea, we considered user scenarios to help identify the features and functionality for the solution. The scenarios outlined below will help illustrate our target users.

Pamela is a recent graduate who is searching for a job. She is open to moving out of Dublin. She does not drive. Some considerations as she searches for a job are:

- The historical trend for jobs in other counties. Mariam wants to know that a county she moves to has a sustained employment rate over recent years.
- Job listings
- Accommodation in close proximity of her job location as she does not drive

Chad is interested in moving to Ireland from US. He does not know much about job opportunities across Ireland nor does he know about job sites or accommodation sites. He is currently doing research for move. He is interested in an application that can help him identify suitable parts of Ireland where he can readily find a job and accommodation in his profession.

Why are they important?

Employment is an important social issue. Employers need to attract and retain staff at a time of skills shortages. A survey by Hays found that 75% of employers had experienced some difficulty filling roles. The same survey found that 29% of employers expect to hire people from outside the country to fill roles.

Jobs and accommodation go hand in hand. Employees need somewhere to live. Several papers and surveys have highlighted the impact of jobs and housing on relocation in Ireland. A 2017 report by Indecon found that employment was the 3rd biggest barrier to returning emigrants after housing and motor related issues (Table 4.1 [https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa-2017/globalirish/Report-on-Returning-Emigrants-2018.pdf](https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa-2017/globalirish/Report-on-Returning-Emigrants-2018.pdf)). From the viewpoint of the employer, a research paper from the American Chamber of Commerce found that &quot;The availability of quality and affordable accommodation has a direct impact on the hiring of talent&quot;.

The problem we solve

Our solution is a web-based application to assist people in their search of jobs and accommodation. Our particular focus is providing this information to assist with relocation. By simplifying access to information on two of the major barriers to relocation, we believe our application helps address the problem. We achieve this by providing users with an interactive interface with the following features:

- The ability to identify the counties with a greater density of relevant jobs
- The ability to drill down and pinpoint the location of a job
- The ability to quickly locate accommodation within a selected radius of the job
