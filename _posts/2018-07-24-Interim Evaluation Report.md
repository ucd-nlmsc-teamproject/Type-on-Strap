## User Evaluation Report

JobMap Team



### What Questions Are You Asking?


#### Overview

Our application aggregates job listings and housing data and presents it to users in a visualized manner. Where previously, users would have had to visit multiple sites for jobs and accommodation; look up locations; correlate these on a map; and then figure out distances, our application does that for them.

We are taking two approaches for evaluation. The first approach evaluates the performance of the system based on two metrics – time (taken to carry out tasks); and accuracy (of the information returned). The second approach is more subjective. Here, we elicit user feedback on the system to give information on ease of use and user experience.

#### Questions

Essentially, our evaluation is based on the following three questions. These questions will help establish whether our system has met the objectives set out at the outset of the project.

1. Does the application provide a user with information quicker than their current manual process
2. Does the information provided by the application accurate
3. Is the application easier to use than the current process?

#### Scenarios

The experiments we have designed address the above three questions. We have a separate experiment to address each question.

We have also base the evaluation on a number of real user scenarios described to us by people we spoke to at the outset of the project.

- Being new to Ireland and nearing the end of your MSc. Programme at UCD. Yu are hunting for You are flexible and open to relocating outside Dublin. You are researching the availability of jobs in your space around the country. You would also need to live within an easy commute of work as you do not drive.

- You are based in Kilkenny where you are working in a job not related to your degree. Yu are planning to move to Dublin. You know where you will be staying as you will have a house share with friends.You would like to live within 20km of work.

## Experimental Methods

Describe each experiment you are proposing under the following headings.

### Experiment 1
#### Overview 

The first experiment is a controlled experiment to

1. Compare the time taken to search for a job and accommodation when using the application compared to the time taken when doing the same search directly on the jobs.ie and myhome.ie sites.
2. Validate the map locations reported by the system are accurate

For this experiment, we will have six users. We will randomly assign these users into two groups of three. A questionnaire will be created with specific questions related to a search for jobs and accommodation.

The first group will be used to establish the baseline for the time measurement. Each member of this group will be given a randomly selected set of counties and job categories. They will then be asked to carry out a search for jobs and accommodation and record the time taken for specific steps in the process. The second group will be asked to perform the same steps using our application and record the time taken.

For the accuracy measurement, there are two considerations - job locations and accommodation locations. For accommodation, the mapped location in myhome.ie will be used as the baseline. For the job locations, there is no equivalent baseline. Instead, the validation will be against a manual Google maps search for the location.

#### Data Collection

Based on the experimental design the data that will be collected is listed below.

1. Name of evaluator
2. Start time
3. Record the time taken to:
  1. Locate 5 jobs related to the allocated category in each allocated county
  2. Locate 2 apartments to let in a 10km radius of each job
  3. Locate 2 apartments to let in a 20km radius of each job
4. Accuracy (For users of the system only)
  1. For each of the jobs identified, manually check that the map location is accurate.
  2. For each of the jobs identified, manually check that the map location matches the location in myhome.ie.
5. End time

This information directly relates to the first two evaluation questions _(&quot;Does the application provide a user with information quicker than their current manual process&quot;; and &quot;Is the information provided by the application accurate&quot;)_,

 and helps establish whether the system does improve on the time taken for carrying out searches.

#### Selected Subjects 

For this experiment, we will have six users. We will randomly assign these users into two groups of three

Subjects in this evaluation would be a mix of professionals and students currently involved in job searches. They will be a mix of IT and non-technical people in order to have a mix of technology capabilities.

Subjects will sourced from the set of colleagues and their contacts who are currently searching for jobs.



#### Data Analysis 

The data obtained from the first evaluation will be analysed on 2 metrics of time and accuracy and the second evaluation approach would help us in evaluating the user satisfaction with results achieved and experience of using the system.

This analysis would help us in identifying a significant difference between the two user group sets in the time taken to complete the tasks and the level of accuracy they obtained in their results.

#### Practical Setup (200 words)

Our experiment will involve a member of the project team sitting with a subject and recording the time taken. The subjects would first be divided into two user group sets, where one group set would be following the general approach of searching information and the other group set would be using our system. The questionnaire will be an online Google form for ease of data  distribution.. The information gathered from the user sets would be used for analyzing the time taken by each user group and the level of accuracy with which they would be able to get the information.

Participants would be asked to search for information based on the scenarios given and record them in a google form. After the first approach of evaluation is performed the user group set who used our application would be given a feedback form, online where they need to share their experience of using our system.

## Experiment 2
#### Overview (200 words)

The objective of this experiment is to compare the ease of use of the system with the previous manual process.

This experiment will take the form of a user survey. This is an extension of the first experiment and will involve the same set of users. Users will be given a survey questionnaire  where they will be given a list of question relating to the ease of use of carrying out specific tasks. Users will then have to rate the system on a scale of 1 – 7:

1=Completely Agree

2= Mostly Agree

3= Slightly Agree

4= neither agree or disagree

5= Slightly Disagree

6= Mostly Disagree

7= Completely Disagree

Users are asked to go through the scenarios where contexts are provided which guides them to perform tasks targeting various levels of functionalities of the site.

This experiment involves natural research of the product use to understand behavior or attitudes as close to reality as possible but also includes scripted parts that is quantitative in nature. The questionnaire acts like an evaluation test extracting metrics based on the user&#39;s answer that falls on a scale between completely agreeing to completely disagreeing. This hybrid research methods use a creative form of product usage to meet the user&#39;s goals helping us understand ways to improve the experience.

### Data Collection (100 words)

The data we collect will be subjective and based on user perception. The data directly relates to the third question.

The data collected would be as below:

1. Was the site useful ?
2. I was able to easily discover jobs that aligns with my interest ?
3. The site was visually appealing and easy to navigate ?
4. A high level of concentration is required when using this system ?
5. I found the system too inflexible ?
6. I would recommend this site to my friends who are in search for jobs and accommodation ?
7. Overall,I had a pleasant experience using JobMap ?

Users will be asked to rate the questions on a scale of 1 - 7:

1=Completely Agree

2= Mostly Agree

3= Slightly Agree

4= neither agree or disagree

5= Slightly Disagree

6= Mostly Disagree

7= Completely Disagree


#### Selected Subjects

Subjects for the questionnaire will be the same user base that carried out the previous time/accuracy evaluation.

#### Data Analysis 


This analysis would help us with how well our system serves the purpose for which it was designed for, and how happy are the users in using in their day basis. We have taken a scale of 1 -7 on which the users would be rating the system they have used. Based on the answers we  get from users we can analyse how well would our system serves the purpose and how happy are the users in using the system.

#### Practical Setup

The survey will be an online experiment. The users will be the same user base that evaluated the performance of the system. Users will be required to complete the survey immediately following completion of the previous experiment in order to accurately capture their perceptions.

### Conclusions

It takes an experiential approach, putting experience before functionality and leaving behind oversimplified calls for ease, efficiency, and automation or shallow beautification (Hassenzahl, 2010). Instead, we aim to learn how to design an experiment to understand the user&#39;s perspective and what it needs to make technology more meaningful.

Challenges expected revolves mostly around people&#39;s attitude towards navigation. People are different, their goals circle around their situations/context. Being able to measure and understand how they would get around navigating the elements and using the features to solve the challenge of finding job and accommodation no matter what their background story is, is a challenge in itself. People try to achieve the tasks similarly but approach it with different perspectives. To be able to understand these user flows and allow for a wider contextual scene to accommodate all kinds of situations while designing the experiment is the biggest challenge.
